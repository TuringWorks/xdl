=== Rayleigh-Taylor Instability Demo ===

Grid size:  32 x 32 x 32
Created  32 x 32 x 32  volume
Total voxels:  32768

Note: Full RT simulation with time evolution requires
FOR loop support in the parser. This demo shows the
framework working with static data.

Initializing 3D visualization...
VIZ3D: Initialized (1280x720)
Setting colormap to RAINBOW
VIZ3D: Set colormap to RAINBOW
VIZ3D: Camera configured
Loading volume to GPU...
VIZ3D: Loaded volume 32x32x32 (32768 voxels)
Rendering volume...

Controls:
  - Left mouse: Rotate camera
  - Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
  - ESC: Close window

VIZ3D: Rendering volume (interactive=false)
  Volume: 32x32x32
  Colormap: RAINBOW
  Backend: ThreeJS

Visualization prepared (non-interactive mode).
Note: Use /INTERACTIVE keyword to open 3D window.


=== Demo Complete ===

To see full RT instability with time evolution:
1. Parser needs to support nested FOR loops
2. Parser needs to support IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF blocks
3. Then use examples/demo/rayleigh_taylor.xdl

VIZ3D framework is ready and working!
