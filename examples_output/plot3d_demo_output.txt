=== 3D Plot Demo Complete ===

3D plotting capabilities demonstrated:
  - SURFACE: 3D wireframe surfaces
  - CONTOUR: 2D contour plots
  - SHADE_SURF: 3D shaded surfaces
  - PLOT3D: 3D parametric line plots

Note: All surface data created using nested array literals
Example: z = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

Additional 3D procedures available:
  - SHADE_SURF_IRR: Irregular surface grids
  - SURFR: Rectangular surfaces
  - ISOCONTOUR: 3D isosurface contours
  - ISOSURFACE: 3D isosurface rendering
  - T3D, SCALE3, SHOW3: 3D transformations

Try modifying the nested arrays to create your own 3D visualizations!
