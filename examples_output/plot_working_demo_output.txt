=== Graphics Demo Complete ===

Successfully demonstrated:
  - PLOT: 2D line plotting with FINDGEN arrays
  - Mathematical functions: SIN, COS, EXP
  - Interactive GUI plotting windows

Note: 3D procedures (SURFACE, CONTOUR, SHADE_SURF, PLOT3D)
      are registered but not yet fully implemented.

To test in CLI mode: cargo run --release --bin xdl examples/plot_working_demo.xdl
To test with GUI: cargo run --release --bin xdl-gui examples/plot_working_demo.xdl
