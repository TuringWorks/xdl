; Test script for GUI responsiveness
; This script performs intensive computations that should run in background

; Create large arrays and perform computations
n = 1000
x = findgen(n)
y = x * 2.0

; Simulate complex computation
z = sin(x / 10.0) * cos(y / 20.0)

; More intensive operations
sum_val = 0
for i = 0, n-1 do begin
  sum_val = sum_val + z[i]
endfor

; Print result
print, "Sum of z:", sum_val

; Create plot
plot, x, z
