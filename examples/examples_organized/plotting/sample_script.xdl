; Sample XDL Script
; This is a test script to demonstrate GUI functionality

; Define variables
x = findgen(50)
y = sin(x / 10.0)
z = cos(x / 5.0)

; Print some information
print, "Generated arrays x, y, and z"
print, "X array size:", size(x)
print, "Y contains sine values"
print, "Z contains cosine values"

; Create a plot
plot, x, y

; Some mathematical operations
result = max(y)
print, "Maximum value of y:", result

; End of script
print, "Script execution completed"
